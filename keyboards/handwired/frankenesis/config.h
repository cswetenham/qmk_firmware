// Allows sending more than one key per scan. By default, only one key event gets sent via process_record() per scan. This has little impact on most typing, but if you're doing a lot of chords, or your scan rate is slow to begin with, you can have some delay in processing key events. Each press and release is a separate event. For a keyboard with 1ms or so scan times, even a very fast typist isn't going to produce the 500 keystrokes a second needed to actually get more than a few ms of delay from this. But if you're doing chording on something with 3-4ms scan times? You probably want this.

 * Force NKRO
 *
 * Force NKRO (nKey Rollover) to be enabled by default, regardless of the saved
 * state in the bootmagic EEPROM settings. (Note that NKRO must be enabled in the
 * makefile for this to work.)
 *
 * If forced on, NKRO can be disabled via magic key (default = LShift+RShift+N)
 * until the next keyboard reset.
 *
 * NKRO may prevent your keystrokes from being detected in the BIOS, but it is
 * fully operational during normal computer usage.
 *
 * For a less heavy-handed approach, enable NKRO via magic key (LShift+RShift+N)
 * or via bootmagic (hold SPACE+N while plugging in the keyboard). Once set by
 * bootmagic, NKRO mode will always be enabled until it is toggled again during a
 * power-up.
